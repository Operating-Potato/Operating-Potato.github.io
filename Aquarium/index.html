                <p>This is an animated virtual gallery of various fish species. </p>
                <p>A fish is an animal that generally lives in water, breathes primarily with gills, has fins, and is ectothermic, though there are exceptions to all of these.</p>
                <ul><p><b>The three primary groups of fish still extant today are:</b></p>
                <li>Jawless fish: fish that don't have a jaw to open and close. Currently represented by lampreys and hagfish.</li>
                <li>Cartilaginous fish: sharks, rays, chimaeras, etc. Have a skeleton made of cartilage rather than bone.</li>
                <li>Bony fish: the vast majority of fish on earth now. Have a skeleton made of bone. Divided into two groups. Lobe-finned fish have a lobe surrounded by fleshy parts, and are the ancestors of all land vertebrates, and include coelacanths and lungfish. Ray-finned fish have spiny fins with membranes between the spines, and are probably what you think of when you think "fish."</li>
